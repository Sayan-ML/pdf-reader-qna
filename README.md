An interactive **Streamlit app** that lets you upload PDFs, ask questions, and get **AI-powered answers**.  
If the answer isn’t found in your documents, it will automatically **search the web**.  
You can also **download answers as PDFs** or even **send them via email** with attachments.

- 🧠 Powered by **Google Gemini API** (via LangChain)  
- 📑 Save Q&A history in **SQLite database**  
- 📤 Download single or combined answers as **PDF reports**

## ⚙️ How it Works
1. **Upload PDFs** → Click **Build/Refresh Index**  
2. **Ask a Question** → Click **Ask**  
3. The app first searches inside your uploaded PDFs  
4. If no relevant answer is found → performs a **Web Search** (via SerpAPI)  
5. Displays the best possible answer on screen  
6. Options:  
   - 📥 Download as a PDF  
   - 📧 Send the result to your email (with/without PDF attachment)  

---

## 🔑 API Keys Required
You need the following API keys to run the app:  

- **Google Gemini API Key** → Get it from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)  
- **SerpAPI Key** → Create a free account at [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/)  

👉 Paste your keys into the **sidebar input fields** in the app.

## 📧 Email Setup
This app can send answers via **SMTP email**.  

Provide the following in the sidebar:
- **SMTP host** (default: `smtp.gmail.com`)  
- **SMTP port** (`465` for SSL or `587` for TLS)  
- **SMTP email (username)**  
- **SMTP password / App password**  
- **Recipient email**  

⚠️ **Tip for Gmail Users:**  
- Go to [Google Account Security → App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)  
- Generate a 16-character **app password**  
- Use that instead of your normal Gmail password
